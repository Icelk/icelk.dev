# [icelk.dev](https://icelk.dev/)

This is the source of my personal website.
To get the full version running, [download the fonts](download-fonts.sh) and start
the [Kvarn reference implementation](https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-reference) with
```shell
$ cargo r --features nc,high_ports
```
to disable cache for testing and run it on high ports, so you don't need superuser privileges.
