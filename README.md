This is the source of my personal website.
To get the full version running, [download the fonts](download-fonts.sh) and start
the [Kvarn reference implementation](https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-reference) with

```shell
$ cargo r --features high_ports
```

to run it on high ports (8080, 8443), so you don't need superuser privileges.
