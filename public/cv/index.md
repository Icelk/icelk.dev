## Summary

I'm a student at Polhemskolan, a college-preparatory school where I'm studying
nature with a focus on physics. In early 2022, I competed with the 25 others in
the Sweden finals for [EOES](https://www.eoes.science/npo/association.html).
I've programmed C-like languages since I was 12 years old. At first, I wrote
several prototype games in Unity using C#. When I discovered Rust, I realized
it's convenient features and immense speed. Now, I'm using it for all my
projects. Since then I've created
[several high quality Rust projects](https://github.com/Icelk?tab=repositories&q=&language=rust).

I find learning new things and exploring opportunities to be very exciting.
Getting down to deliver in time for release is a fun part of being an open
source developer. Having clear goals and reasons for them motivates me. This
enables me to find the best solution regarding time spent, performance, and
simplicity. I find it important to keep a good attitude and enjoy easing the
atmosphere. In the future, I see myself work with a team solving difficult
problems in a company with a culture of human equity.

## Achievements

-   A [full-text search engine](https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter)
    ([used](https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-search) by this website)
-   A [web server](https://kvarn.org) with tooling which entirely powers this
    website
-   A [fractal renderer](https://github.com/Icelk/fractal-renderer)
-   A [real-time data syncing library](https://agde.dev/) with support for
    binary
-   An [IOT service](/httPWM/) for controlling the PWM on a Raspberry Pi
-   The design and branding of my websites

Everyting is naturally open-sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/Icelk/). I'm
also well-versed in the JavaScript community (especially TypeScript). The code
of this website and [Kvarn's](https://kvarn.org) is written by me. I've also
written a [GitHub action](https://github.com/Icelk/rustdoc-link-check) in
JavaScript.

Collaboration speeds up and improves quality when coding. For over a year, I've
been using Git and GitHub to make
[pull requests](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/pull/915) to other people's
code. At school, I've been teaching fellow students programming.

## Personal

On my spare time I like to, well, code. It brings me joy to work on impressive
projects and to contribute to a greater goal. I consider my skills on par with
computer science students, considering my understanding of data structures and
low-level computing. Besides programming, I play tennis twice a week and
in-between I go running. I feel it's important to get some fresh air and to
exercise.
