<p>As an European going overseas, I like to travel the streets by foot and bike. I
find, exploration on ground level without windshields blocking the view, gives a
better picture of the city or town I’m visiting. This applies both in Europe and
the Americas. The fine details of the great American society right under my
nose.</p>

<p>The hurricane being the deadliest in nearly 100 years, news soon reached all
around the world. Swedish media was not spared from the graphic images of houses
literally blown away. The images above mirror the general look of these early
insights, from ground-level.</p>
<img class="w2p" src="media/hurricane-ian/PXL_20230102_153056234.jpg" srcset="media/hurricane-ian/PXL_20230102_153056234.jpg 4000w, media/hurricane-ian/PXL_20230102_153056234-small.jpg 1000w" sizes="35vw" alt="empty Miami street, just a few blocks away from downtown, in the middle of the day (FP4)" loading="lazy" />

<p>On an adventure to discover and collect exotic kinds of shells, we realized the
grave situation on Florida’s west coast. Disappointed by the closed causeway to
Sanibel, I searched for answers and found the extent of destruction mapped on
<a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/27c1613132ac4bbf91c17f203b66ff0b">the county’s website</a>.
One of my cotravellers who’s been to Chernobyl equated the atmosphere; all homes
were evacuated, streets barren, houses upside down. Driving through the rubble,
we saw glimpses of people’s lives—glades through torn walls. However, the eerie
vibe wasn’t just comparable to nuclear accidents.</p>
<p>Earlier this year while visiting Seattle, the same empty dystopian feeling
reached through me. Then I didn’t think much of it (since I was walking the hard
shoulder on a highway bridge over an Interstate), but in hindsight the vehicular
dependency in the States creates an alien feeling as compared to the density of
Europe. The withered sternness of going 1 mile from the nearest parking lot is
captured by the images around this paragraph.</p>

<p>The sights were stunning. Houses laid on their sides, as if they’d taken a
misstep. Some weren’t recognizable. Others had been swallowed by Earth. No
people were to be found, take some volunteers clearing the vast beach. Massive
concrete resorts stood tall, yet empty. Vegetation turned brown. Disaster
recovery trucks everywhere, yet no activity. Rubble filling every dent in the
ground. American flags hang proudly, yet no Americans to be found.</p>

<p>As we went south, contradictorily, things got better. Here, some had been lucky
to survive with mere scratches. Others weren’t so lucky. Chance decided who’s
life was flushed and who could move back in after a month.</p>

<p>After rain comes sunshine, as they say. Arguably not in this situation. Though,
some shards of beauty shone through the storms. The shells were plentiful and
contrasted nicely with the grim backdrop.</p>

<p>The journey through Fort Myers Beach, Lovers Key, and Naples gave me an
important perspective of how distant news and suffering have become. Just as far
away and abstract as disaster-news is climate change. But instead of us
travelling to Fort Myers, global warming has a course aimed right at us, with no
ability to slow down. Time doesn’t care. Instead, let us prevent a cataclysmic
catastrophe before it reaches us.</p>
<p>I hope this article conveyed some of the drenching emotions I experienced while
<a href="https://youtu.be/IwBS6QGsH_4?t=77">going to Miami</a>.</p>
