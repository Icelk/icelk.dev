<p>Tl;dr, see the <a href="#resolution">resolution heading</a>.</p>
<h1 id="backstory">Backstory</h1>
<p>How stupid can she be? “Does she think she’s cool,” I think. I’ve just heard Christine has been on a vaccine protest.
And she’s proudly telling us.</p>
<p>She explains how everyone should have a right to choose, and be respected. I don’t think so, not when she’s spreading a deadly disease.
She claim it’s killing kids and not even making us resistant to the virus. Of course - it <strong>increases</strong> our resistance, not eliminate the virus.</p>
<p>A friend I’m hanging out with joins. He attributes the lack of nuance and intuition on the subject to social media and profits-first corporations.
He affirms my thought, saying it’s not black or white, but it certainly helps.</p>
<p>Continuing, he presents a theory. My friend maybe engaged with mild anti vax content - because it seemed mildly interesting.
When the algoritm noticed, it pushed more of the same. It optimizes for interaction, as that’s when they get most ad-revenue, he says.
Having stronger opinions make us angrier and more likely to stay. He establishes this is the reason for the vicious cycle.</p>
<p>This pattern taints your friends other behaviour too, allowing other apps to push similar content; remember, it’s to maximise engagement, he continues.
I see, so now my friend’s trapped inside a <strong>bubble</strong>? He confirms. Soon, all her search results will be heavily skewed, he points out.</p>
<h1 id="resolution">Resolution</h1>
<p>Well shit. How can I protect against it?
He gives his tips; an easy thing is to use a private browser, such as <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a> together with a privacy-first search engine.
He continues to recommend <a href="https://search.brave.com">Brave Search</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>
<p>He also highlights the importance of open-source programs, where anyone can see what it does - if it employs dangerous behaviours.
If you’re ready to push it to the limit, he explains, one can download <a href="https://manjaro.org">Linux</a> and use his <a href="/dns/">DNS resolver</a>.</p>

<p>So, what do you think about this?</p>
