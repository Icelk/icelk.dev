# Monopolistic trouble

It's no doubt tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have monopolies
on many products. **That's bad for consumers.** All are exerting monopolizing -
buying competitors and locking users in. How will this shape our future?

Why wouldn't they? They're companies which need to make money. Having no
competition is easier and worth the trouble.

Once they have sufficient market share (e.g. Google Search, Google Chrome,
Windows, Apple's App Store) or users locked in to their ecosystem (e.g. all of
Apple, Windows with it's bugs, Microsoft Office, Microsoft refusing to let users
change browser, G Suite), the corporations can make decisions negligent of
users' opinion.

The products were great when they appeared, that's how they gained market share,
but over the years, the capitalistic companies have made decisions **focused on
business**, not **consumers**. They can do this, as humans dislike change, and
therefore stick to what their using, regardless of what the owning corporation
dictates.

# Examples

With Google being the gateway for many to the World Wide Web, they can, and
have, made the **web less free**. The latest example is their
[FLoC](https://www.wired.com/story/google-floc-privacy-ad-tracking-explainer/) -
a "privacy improvement" (as stated by Google), which basically ment only Google
could **collect advertisement data of you, while still tracking you**.

Microsoft was subject to controversy when they **required a TPM 2** chip to run
Windows 11. This made many **old PCs unusable**, as only those produced the last
three years have a TPM 2 module.

Microsoft also made switching browsers very difficult at the start of
Windows 11. Independent programmers swiftly created tools to lessen the burden,
and Firefox overcame the challenges. Yet, to hinder consumer choice and push
users to using **their browser, Edge**, they patched all the workarounds.

# Future

As I alluded to at the start, this will most certainly affect the future of
electronics - it'll degrade the quality of a major piller of modern life, to
make large corporations more profitable. And it'll only get worse as their power
increases.

I predict increased monopolization and restriction is eminent.

**If we consumers do not change and use alternatives to suppress Big Tech**,
they will continue to prioritize profits, as there's no need to compete.

# What you can do

**Use alternatives.** [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/),
[DuckDuckGo](https://duck.com/),
[Linux (Manjaro)](https://manjaro.org/download/#kde-plasma),
[Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/),
[Framework laptops](https://frame.work/), and
[LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org/) are all great products which oppose Big
Tech's principles to be beneficial to you, the environment, and
[the society](bubbles.).
