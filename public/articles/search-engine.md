# Building a search engine

So [I built a search engine](https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter).

Following [a course on Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/courses/search-fundamentals/), I decided to code my own full text search engine.
How hard can it be?
3K lines of code in (for just the backend), I can confirm, it's educational, but a pain in the ass.
