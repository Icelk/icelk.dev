<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m a student at Polhemskolan, a college-preparatory school where I’m studying nature with a focus on physics. In early 2022, I competed with the 25 others in the Sweden finals for <a href="https://www.eoes.science/npo/association.html">EOES</a>.
I’ve programmed C-like languages since I was 12 years old.
At first, I wrote several prototype games in Unity. When I discovered Rust, I immediately couldn’t work with C# any more.
Since then I’ve created <a href="https://github.com/Icelk?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;language=rust">several high quality Rust projects</a>.</p>
<p>I find learning new things and exploring opportunities to be very exciting. Getting down to deliver in time for release is a fun part of being an open source developer. Having clear goals and reasons for them motivates me. This enables me to find the best solution regarding time spent, performance, and simplicity. I find it important to keep a good attitude and enjoy easing the atmosphere. In the future, I see myself work with a team solving difficult problems in a company with a culture of human equity. </p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter">full-text search engine</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-search">used</a> by this website)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://kvarn.org">web server</a> with tooling which entirely powers this website</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/fractal-renderer">fractal renderer</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://agde.dev/">real-time data syncing library</a> with support for binary</li>
<li>An <a href="/httPWM/">IOT service</a> for controlling the PWM on a Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>The design and branding of my websites</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyting is naturally open-sourced at <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/">GitHub</a>.
I’m also well-versed in the JavaScript community (especially TypeScript). The code of this website and <a href="https://kvarn.org">Kvarn’s</a> is written by me. I’ve also written a <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/rustdoc-link-check">GitHub action</a> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Collaboration speeds up and improves quality when coding. For over a year, I’ve been using Git and GitHub to make <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/pull/915">pull requests</a> to other people’s code. At school, I’ve been teaching fellow students programming.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>On my spare time I like to, well, code. It brings me joy to work on impressive projects and to contribute to a greater goal. I consider my skills on par with computer science students, considering my understanding of data structures and low-level computing. Besides programming, I play tennis twice a week and in-between I go running. I feel it’s important to get some fresh air and to exercise.</p>
