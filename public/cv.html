<h1 id="cv">CV</h1>
<p>Hi!<br />
I’m Erik, a full-stack developer.
I go to Polhemskolan, a college-preparatory school. I’m studying nature with a focus in physics. In early 2022, I competed with the 25 other in the Sweden finals for <a href="https://www.eoes.science/npo/association.html">EOES</a>.
I’ve programmed C-like languages since I was 12 years old.
Learning new things and exploring opportunities is very exciting. Getting down to deliver in time for release is a fun part of being an open source dev.
At first, I wrote several prototype games in Unity. When I discovered Rust, I immediately couldn’t work with C# any more.
Since then, I’ve created <a href="https://github.com/Icelk?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;language=rust">several high quality Rust projects</a>, including,</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter">full-text search engine</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-search">used</a> by this website)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://kvarn.org">web server</a> with dynamic extension support and over 800 Git commits</li>
<li>A fractal renderer</li>
<li>A real-time data syncing library with support for binary</li>
<li>An <a href="/httPWM/">IOT service</a> for controlling the PWM on a Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyting is naturally open-sourced at <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/">GitHub</a>.
I’m also well-versed in the JavaScript community (especially TypeScript). The code of this website and <a href="https://kvarn.org">Kvarn’s</a> is written by me. I’ve also written a <a href="https://github.com/Icelk/rustdoc-link-check">GitHub action</a> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Collaboration speeds up and improves quality when coding. For over a year, I’ve been using Git and GitHub to make <a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/pull/915">pull requests</a> to other’s code. I’ve taught teenagers programming in school.</p>
<p>On my spare time I like to, well, code. It brings me joy to work on impressive projects and contribute to a greater goal. I consider my skills on par with computer science students, considering my understanding of data structures and low-level computing. I also play tennis twice and run a couple of times per week. I feel it’s important to get some fresh air.</p>
<p>I graduated primary school with straight As. I’m proficient with cooperation and English.</p>
