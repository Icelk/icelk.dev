# CV

Hi!\
I'm Erik, a full-stack developer.
I go to Polhemskolan, a college-preparatory school. I'm studying nature with a focus in physics. In early 2022, I competed with the 25 other in the Sweden finals for [EOES](https://www.eoes.science/npo/association.html).
I've programmed C-like languages since I was 12 years old.
Learning new things and exploring opportunities is very exciting. Getting down to deliver in time for release is a fun part of being an open source dev.
At first, I wrote several prototype games in Unity. When I discovered Rust, I immediately couldn't work with C# any more.
Since then, I've created [several high quality Rust projects](https://github.com/Icelk?tab=repositories&q=&language=rust), including,

- A [full-text search engine](https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter) ([used](https://github.com/Icelk/kvarn-search) by this website)
- A [web server](https://kvarn.org) with dynamic extension support and over 800 Git commits
- A fractal renderer
- A real-time data syncing library with support for binary
- An [IOT service](/httPWM/) for controlling the PWM on a Raspberry Pi

Everyting is naturally open-sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/Icelk/).
I'm also well-versed in the JavaScript community (especially TypeScript). The code of this website and [Kvarn's](https://kvarn.org) is written by me. I've also written a [GitHub action](https://github.com/Icelk/rustdoc-link-check) in JavaScript.

Collaboration speeds up and improves quality when coding. For over a year, I've been using Git and GitHub to make [pull requests](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/pull/915) to other's code. I've taught teenagers programming in school.

On my spare time I like to, well, code. It brings me joy to work on impressive projects and contribute to a greater goal. I consider my skills on par with computer science students, considering my understanding of data structures and low-level computing. I also play tennis twice and run a couple of times per week. I feel it's important to get some fresh air.

I graduated primary school with straight As. I'm proficient with cooperation and English.
